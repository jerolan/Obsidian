**Purpose**: Use this framework recursively to master any topic by leveraging AI, Obsidian, and structured learning techniques.
## 1. **Define Your Learning Goals (Top-Down Initialization)**

1. **Identify the Scope**
    
    - Are you mastering a broad domain (e.g., “Cloud Computing”) or a narrower skill (e.g., “AWS Lambda Functions”)?
    - **Tip:** Start broad, then break down the domain into subtopics or modules.
2. **Set SMART Objectives**
    
    - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
    - **Example:** “Learn the fundamentals of AWS Lambda, focusing on Node.js 20 runtime and best practices for resiliency.”
3. **Create a Big-Picture Outline**
    
    - Draft a simple roadmap (e.g., **Module 1: Basic Concepts**, **Module 2: Building & Deploying**, **Module 3: Advanced Use Cases**, etc.).
    - This top-level structure provides direction and helps you see how subtopics fit together.

**Artifacts & Tools**

- **Obsidian**: Create a **Master Goal Sheet** and a high-level outline note.
- **Templater Plugin**: Use a template to standardize how you define goals and sub-goals.

    - Summarize each resource (books, articles) and link them back to the module.
2. **Use Metadata & Tags**
    
    - Add YAML front matter to each note (e.g., `title`, `topic`, `status`).
    - Tag subtopics (`#aws-lambda`, `#resiliency`, `#nodejs20`) to facilitate advanced searches and queries.
3. **Visualize Connections**
    
    - **Mermaid** or **Excalidraw** diagrams can show how modules or subtopics relate.
    - Use backlinks and Dataview queries to see related notes or concepts.

## **Conclusion: A System for Lifelong Learning**

This **top-down, modular, and recursive** approach—powered by **AI**—ensures you can **zoom in** on the details or **zoom out** to the big picture at any time. By **iterating** the same steps (goals → resources → structuring → active learning → reflection → measurement → collaboration → automation → application → recursion), you build a robust, **scalable** system for **mastering any topic**.

Feel free to customize each phase, swap in preferred tools, or adjust the depth of AI integration as your needs evolve. With consistent practice and refinement, you’ll not only learn faster but also **retain** and **apply** knowledge more effectively in real-world settings.
