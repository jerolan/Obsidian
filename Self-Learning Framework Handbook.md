## **Phase 1: Define Your Learning Goals**

GPT: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67704e2fd324819194d1d1b68af08620-lafw-master-notes-creator

### Step 1: Identify the Scope

- Ask yourself:
  - What do I want to learn?
  - Is it a broad domain (e.g., "Cloud Computing") or a specific skill (e.g., "AWS Lambda")?
- **Write it down** in a **Master Goal Note** in Obsidian.

### Step 2: Break Down the Topic

- Divide the topic into **modules** or **subtopics**.
  - Example for "Cloud Computing":
    1. Basics of Cloud Computing.
    2. AWS Services Overview.
    3. Building Serverless Applications.
- Create a **roadmap note** in Obsidian.

### Step 3: Define SMART Objectives

- Set objectives for each module:
  - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
  - Example: "Learn AWS Lambda basics and deploy a sample Node.js app within 2 weeks."

### Step 1: Gather Resources

- **Books**: Identify foundational and advanced books.
- **Articles & Papers**: Save relevant blog posts, whitepapers, or research.
- **Courses**: Enroll in online video tutorials or interactive modules.
- **Case Studies**: Find practical, real-world examples.

### Step 2: Organize in Obsidian

1. Create a folder for the topic:
   - E.g., `/Learning/CloudComputing/`.
2. Add subfolders for modules or resource types:
   - `/Books/`, `/Articles/`, `/Courses/`.
3. Link resources in your **Master Goal Note** or **Module Notes**.

### Step 3: Use AI to Assist

- Ask **ChatGPT** or **Ollama** to:
  - Summarize articles.
  - Recommend additional resources.
  - Extract key points from books or papers.

**Tools**:

- **Obsidian Web Clipper**: Save web pages into Obsidian.

## **Phase 3: Organize and Structure Knowledge**

GPT: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6771ec127d64819184f499b3c787f367-obsidian-metadata-assistant

### Step 1: Create Module Notes

- For each module:

  1. Create a **dedicated note**.
  2. Add YAML front matter with metadata:

     ```yaml
     ---
     title: Basics of AWS Lambda
     status: in-progress
     tags: [#aws, #lambda, #serverless]
     ---
     ```

  3. Include sections:
     - Summary.
     - Key Points.
     - Reflections.
     - Resources.

### Step 2: Link Related Notes

- Use backlinks (`[[Note Title]]`) to connect:
  - Modules to subtopics.
  - Notes to related resources.

### Step 3: Visualize Connections

- Create **mind maps** or **flowcharts** to map relationships.
  - **Tools**:
    - **Excalidraw**: Draw diagrams directly in Obsidian.
    - **Mermaid**: Use Markdown-like syntax for flowcharts.

---

## **Phase 4: Active Learning and Practice**

### Step 1: Use AI-Powered Q&A

1. Ask GPT to:
   - Clarify doubts.
   - Generate examples or code snippets.
2. Use embedding-based search tools like **LangChain** to query your notes.

### Step 2: Create Flashcards

- Extract key points from your notes into **Anki** or **Obsidian’s Supercharged Spaced Repetition Plugin**.

### Step 3: Work on Projects

- Apply knowledge practically:
  - Build apps or write essays.
  - Analyze case studies.
  - Conduct experiments.

---

## **Phase 5: Reflection and Iteration**

### Step 1: Maintain a Learning Journal

- Use **Periodic Notes** to:
  - Reflect daily/weekly.
  - Document:
    - What you’ve learned.
    - Challenges faced.
    - Next steps.

### Step 2: Self-Assess

- Create a short quiz or mini-project for each module.
- Use **GPT-4** to generate questions:
  - Example: “Write a quiz about AWS Lambda functions.”

### Step 3: Adjust Your Plan

- Based on your reflections, decide:
  - Should I go deeper into this topic?
  - Is there a related topic I need to explore next?

---

## **Phase 6: Measure and Validate Learning**

### Step 1: Define Completion Criteria

- For each module:
  - Example: “Successfully deploy a working Lambda function.”

### Step 2: Track Milestones

- Use **Kanban Plugin**:
  - Create boards:
    - To Learn → In Progress → Completed.
- Use **Dataview** for dynamic dashboards.

### Step 3: Validate Knowledge

- Share projects or essays with peers.
- Ask AI for feedback:
  - “Review my solution for deploying a Lambda function.”

---

## **Phase 7: Collaboration and Community**

### Step 1: Join Communities

- Participate in forums (Reddit, Discord) for your topic.
- Share insights or seek advice.

### Step 2: Peer Teaching

- Write blog posts or Twitter threads summarizing what you’ve learned.
- Teach others to reinforce your understanding.

---

## **Phase 8: Automation and Optimization**

### Step 1: Automate Routine Tasks

- Use **Templater** to:
  - Create standardized notes.
  - Auto-summarize content with GPT.

### Step 2: Use Embedding Databases

- Implement **Faiss** or **LangChain** to:
  - Store embeddings of notes.
  - Enable semantic search and context-aware Q&A.

---

## **Phase 9: Recursive Application**

### Step 1: Drill Down into Subtopics

- Identify areas needing deeper exploration.
- Apply the framework again for those subtopics.

### Step 2: Connect Back to the Big Picture

- Link detailed notes back to higher-level modules.
- Create **overview summaries**.
