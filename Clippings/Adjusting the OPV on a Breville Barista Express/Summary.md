### **Adjusting the OPV on a Breville Barista Express to 9-9.5 BAR: A Comprehensive Guide**

---

#### **Introduction**

The Breville Barista Express is a popular semi-automatic espresso machine, prized for its versatility and quality. Adjusting the Over Pressure Valve (OPV) helps ensure optimal brewing pressure, typically around 9–9.5 BAR, leading to improved espresso extraction and taste. This guide walks you through the adjustment process safely and effectively.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Preparation**

1. **Ensure the machine is cool**:
   - Before beginning, confirm the machine hasn't been used recently. Internal components can become dangerously hot.
2. **Gather necessary tools**:
   - **Philips screwdriver**: Preferably magnetic for easier handling of screws.
   - **Small flathead screwdriver**: For prying off caps and accessing tight spots.
   - **Small zip ties**: Approximately 4 cm wide, rated for high temperatures (185°C recommended).

#### **2. Initial Disassembly**

1. **Remove external components**:

   - Detach the **water tank** to expose screws for the back panel.
   - Remove the **grinder hopper** and consider vacuuming out any leftover coffee beans.
   - Take off the **drip tray** and the **tamp** from its magnet.

2. **Unscrew the front screws**:

   - Locate two screws beneath the front, near the hot water spout and tamp holder magnet.

3. **Unscrew the back panel**:

   - Remove five screws along the top edge.
   - Pry off the small circular cap underneath the water tank using a flathead screwdriver. Depending on the machine model, there may be additional caps.

4. **Unscrew the bottom panel**:

   - Remove two visible screws and two hidden ones near the machine's feet.

#### **3. Accessing the OPV**

1. **Open the machine**:

   - Carefully pop open the top portion. Be cautious, as electrical wires remain connected.
   - Gently detach the back panel, noting the plastic clamps. Apply light, consistent force to avoid cracking these components.

2. **Locate the OPV**:

   - Find the "T"-shaped tube with a black clamp. This is the Over Pressure Valve.

3. **Detach the OPV tubing**:

   - Use a flathead screwdriver or similar tool to loosen or cut the zip tie securing the tube. Be careful not to damage the tube.

4. **Expose the OPV screw**:

   - Separate the black clamp to reveal the valve screw.

#### **4. Adjusting the OPV**

1. **Mark the screw's position**:

   - Use a marker to create a visual reference for tracking your adjustments.

2. **Turn the screw**:

   - Rotate the screw counterclockwise in small increments.
   - Perform 2–3 full turns for optimal pressure adjustment. Note: Over-rotating can cause the screw to detach, so proceed with caution.

#### **5. Reassembly and Testing**

1. **Reattach the OPV tubing**:

   - Secure the tube with a new zip tie, ensuring it’s snug but not overly tight.

2. **Reassemble the machine**:

   - Replace the back panel, top portion, water tank, and drip tray without fully tightening screws.

3. **Perform a blind disc test**:

   - Run a pressure test using a blind filter basket. Observe the gauge and aim for the 9–9.5 BAR range. Adjust further if necessary.

4. **Secure all components**:

   - Once the pressure is correct, tighten all screws and reattach the grinder hopper.

---

#### **6. Final Testing**

1. **Pull an espresso shot**:
   - Test the machine with a typical espresso shot to ensure optimal extraction.
   - Confirm the shot flows smoothly, and the pressure gauge stays within the desired range.

### **Safety and Maintenance Tips**

- **Safety first**: Always work with a cool machine to avoid burns or electrical hazards.
- **Handle with care**: Avoid applying excessive force, especially on plastic clamps and screws.
- **Track progress**: Keep screws and components organized during disassembly and reassembly.
- **Regular maintenance**: Periodically check the OPV and internal components to maintain consistent performance.
