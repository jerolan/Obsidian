### **Goal**

To master the art and science of coffee roasting by understanding its principles, processes, and techniques as described in "The Coffee Roaster's Companion" by Scott Rao.
### Objectives

1. **Specific**: Learn and apply the chemical, physical, and sensory principles of coffee roasting.
2. **Measurable**: Achieve consistent roast profiles for at least three bean types over a month with defined flavor outcomes.
3. **Achievable**: Dedicate 5 hours per week to study and practice roasting.
4. **Relevant**: Use roasting to enhance coffee quality and deepen appreciation for specialty coffee.
5. **Time-bound**: Master the foundational skills in 8 weeks and advanced techniques in 12 weeks.
### **Learning Modules**

[[Roadmap]]
#### **Module 1: Foundations of Coffee Roasting**

- **Topics**:
    - Why we roast coffee beans.
    - Basic physical and chemical changes during roasting.
    - Overview of green coffee chemistry.
- **Key Takeaways**:
    - Understand the purpose of roasting: flavor optimization and chemical transformation.
    - Recognize the stages of roasting (color change, moisture loss, structural expansion).
    - Study green coffee components: lipids, proteins, sugars, and acids.

#### **Module 2: Roast Profiles and Development**

- **Topics**:
    - Roast progression phases: drying, Maillard, caramelization.
    - Roast degree classifications: light, medium, dark.
    - Inner-bean vs. outer-bean development.
- **Key Takeaways**:
    - Master profiling techniques to balance acidity, sweetness, and bitterness.
    - Use data-logging software to ensure consistency.
    - Understand the sensory impact of roast levels.

#### **Module 3: Heat Transfer and Equipment**

- **Topics**:
    - Convection, conduction, and radiation in roasting.
    - Types of roasters: drum, fluid-bed, recirculating air systems.
    - Machine-specific roasting strategies.
- **Key Takeaways**:
    - Select and optimize equipment for precise heat management.
    - Adapt roasting techniques based on machine type.

#### **Module 4: Sensory Analysis and Quality Control**

- **Topics**:
    - Cupping roasted coffee for flavor evaluation.
    - Identifying defects and adjusting roast profiles.
    - Storage and freshness considerations.
- **Key Takeaways**:
    - Develop a palate for evaluating aroma, body, and acidity.
    - Implement quality control protocols to ensure consistent output.

### **Resources**

- **Primary Resource**: _The Coffee Roaster's Companion_ by Scott Rao.
- **Supplementary Tools**:
    - Roasting machine
    - Logs from Kaffelogic.
    - Coffee cupping tools: spoons, scales.

### **Practical Tips**

1. **Start Small**: Focus on single-origin beans to minimize variables.
2. **Record Everything**: Keep detailed notes of time, temperature, and outcomes for each batch.
3. **Taste Often**: Frequent cupping will refine your sensory skills.
4. **Iterate**: Use feedback from cupping to adjust roast profiles incrementally.
