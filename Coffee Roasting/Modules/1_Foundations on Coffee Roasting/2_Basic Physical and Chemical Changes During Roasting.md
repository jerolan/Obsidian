Roasting coffee beans involves profound physical and chemical changes that transform dense, green seeds into flavorful, aromatic, and soluble brown beans. These transformations are critical to coffee's final taste, aroma, and texture. Below is a detailed breakdown of the processes involved.

### **Physical Changes**

1. **Color Transformation**

   - **From Green to Yellow**: Early roasting heats the beans, evaporating surface moisture and breaking down chlorophyll, causing the green color to fade.
   - **From Yellow to Tan/Brown**: As Maillard reactions begin, the beans shift to tan and brown shades, indicating chemical browning.
   - **Darkening to Black**: Caramelization and further Maillard reactions deepen the color. In darker roasts, carbonization can turn the beans nearly black.

2. **Moisture Loss**

   - Raw beans contain 10-12% water, which evaporates rapidly during roasting. Moisture loss is essential for flavor development, as it concentrates other compounds.
   - By the end of roasting, moisture content typically reduces to about 2%, accounting for up to 90% of the beans' weight loss.

3. **Expansion and Density Reduction**

   - The buildup of internal pressure from steam and CO₂ forces the beans to expand, nearly doubling their size. This structural expansion reduces density by about half, making the beans lighter and easier to grind.
   - The expansion also contributes to the release of the silver skin, or chaff, trapped in the folds of the beans.

4. **Structural Changes**

   - The cellulose matrix of the beans becomes more brittle and porous due to heat and moisture evaporation. This brittleness improves grindability and allows better water penetration during brewing.

5. **Weight Loss**

   - Weight loss during roasting is due to the evaporation of water and the release of gases like CO₂. Typical weight loss ranges:
     - Light roast: 11-13%
     - Medium roast: 14-16%
     - Dark roast: 18-24%

6. **First and Second Crack**

   - **First Crack**: Around 390°F (199°C), internal pressure causes the beans to fracture audibly. This marks the transition to light roasting and signifies the start of substantial flavor development.
   - **Second Crack**: Occurring at higher temperatures (~440°F or 227°C), the release of additional CO₂ and volatile compounds creates a second series of cracks. This marks darker roast levels and greater caramelization.

### **Chemical Changes**

1. **Maillard Reactions**

   - These browning reactions occur between amino acids and reducing sugars. They begin at around 300°F (150°C) and produce compounds responsible for roasted, meaty, and baked flavors.
   - Maillard reactions contribute to coffee's brown color, bittersweet taste, and complex aromas.

2. **Caramelization**

   - The breakdown of sucrose begins at ~340°F (171°C), creating compounds that contribute to caramel, nutty, and toasty flavors.
   - While caramelization enhances sweetness initially, prolonged roasting decreases sweetness and increases bitterness.

3. **Acid Dynamics**

   - Chlorogenic acids (CGA), which account for 6-8% of green coffee's dry weight, degrade during roasting into quinic and caffeic acids. This breakdown reduces sourness and contributes body and brightness.
   - Light roasts retain more CGA, leading to higher perceived acidity, while dark roasts develop smoother, less acidic profiles due to further acid degradation.

4. **Aromatic Development**

   - Roasting creates over 800 volatile aromatic compounds, forming fruity, floral, earthy, nutty, and smoky notes.
   - Aroma compounds reach their peak in light to medium roasts. Excessive roasting can destroy these compounds, leading to burnt or smoky flavors.

5. **Sugar and Protein Interactions**

   - Reducing sugars interact with proteins and amino acids during Maillard reactions, creating melanoidins—large brown molecules that add body and roasted flavors.
   - As roasting progresses, sucrose decomposes, shifting the flavor profile from sweet and acidic to caramelized and bitter.

6. **Lipid Reactions**

   - Lipids, or fats, within the beans (approximately 16% of their dry weight) retain aromatic compounds and contribute to coffee's mouthfeel.
   - These lipids may oxidize during prolonged storage, so fresh roasted coffee is preferred for optimal flavor.

7. **Gas and Vapor Release**

   - Steam and gases like CO₂ build up inside the beans, creating internal pressure. Upon release, these gases contribute to roasting sounds (cracks) and influence the flavor.
   - After roasting, beans continue to release CO₂ during a degassing period, which is crucial for brewing quality.

8. **Caffeine Stability**

   - Contrary to popular belief, caffeine content remains stable during roasting, as caffeine molecules are not significantly affected by the temperatures used.

### **Impact on Brewability**

- **Porosity and Solubility**: The expansion and brittleness of roasted beans improve grind uniformity and allow water to extract flavors more effectively during brewing.
- **Flavor Concentration**: Moisture loss and chemical transformations condense soluble compounds, enhancing coffee's strength and complexity.

### **Summary**

The physical and chemical changes during roasting are intricately linked, each playing a role in developing the flavors, aromas, and textures that define coffee. These changes also make coffee grindable, soluble, and brewable, ensuring a satisfying cup for enthusiasts and casual drinkers alike.
