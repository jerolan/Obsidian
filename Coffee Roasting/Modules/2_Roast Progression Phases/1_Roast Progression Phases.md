#### **Introduction to Roast Progression Phases**

The roasting process of coffee transforms green beans into aromatic, flavorful coffee through a series of chemical reactions and physical changes. These changes occur across three main phases: the **Drying Phase**, the **Maillard Phase**, and the **Caramelization Phase**. Each phase contributes distinct sensory and structural characteristics to the beans.

#### **1. Drying Phase**

- **Purpose**: This phase is primarily concerned with removing moisture from the beans, which starts at their raw green state.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Moisture content drops from ~10-12% to below 5%.
  - Chlorophyll degrades, causing the beans to change color from green to yellow.
  - No significant aroma development occurs during this phase, but it sets the stage for reactions in subsequent phases.
- **Temperature Range**: Generally starts at room temperature and climbs to about 300°F (149°C).
- **Duration**: Typically lasts for 4-8 minutes, depending on the roast profile and machine settings.

#### **2. Maillard Phase**

- **Purpose**: Known as the browning stage, this phase focuses on non-enzymatic browning reactions that define the core aroma and flavor profile of coffee.
- **Key Reactions**:
  - **Maillard Reaction**: Reducing sugars react with amino acids, producing glycosylamines and melanoidins.
    - These compounds contribute to the caramel, nutty, and roasty flavors.
    - Color changes from yellow to light brown.
- **Temperature Range**: Approximately 300°F to 370°F (149°C to 188°C).
- **Significance**:
  - Develops fruity, floral, and sweet aromatic compounds.
  - Enhances the bean's complexity and structure for extraction.
- **Key Considerations**: Roasters must control heat application carefully to avoid over-accelerating the reaction, which could lead to bitterness or uneven development.

#### **3. Caramelization Phase**

- **Purpose**: Focused on the thermal breakdown of sugars, this phase defines the roast’s sweetness, bitterness, and body.
- **Key Reactions**:
  - **Caramelization**: Heat decomposes sugars into smaller, often aromatic, compounds and larger, brown, flavorless polymers.
  - Adds bitter and sour notes alongside aromatic complexity.
- **Temperature Range**: Begins around 370°F (188°C) and extends until the end of the roast.
- **Physical Changes**:
  - The beans become darker, moving from medium brown to deep brown, and eventually black in the case of very dark roasts.
  - Bean expansion is most noticeable, and oils may migrate to the surface in darker roasts.
- **Sensory Impact**:
  - Lighter caramelization retains sweetness and acidity.
  - Prolonged caramelization in dark roasts decreases sweetness and enhances bitterness.

#### **Significance of Each Phase in Flavor Development**

- **Drying Phase**:
  - Essential for preparing the beans for subsequent chemical reactions.
  - Ensures even heat distribution and prevents scorching in later stages.
- **Maillard Phase**:
  - Shapes the bean's primary flavor identity.
  - Balancing time and temperature is crucial to achieving desirable complexity without overdevelopment.
- **Caramelization Phase**:
  - Enhances the body and depth of the coffee while defining its sweetness-bitter balance.
  - Excessive heat or prolonged roasting risks carbonization and the dominance of burnt flavors.

### Practical Considerations

1. **Heat Management**: Consistent control of heat ensures uniform development across all beans.
2. **Roast Profiling**: Precise adjustments during each phase allow roasters to target specific flavor outcomes, such as acidity, sweetness, or bitterness.
3. **Sensory Testing**: Tasting and evaluating each roast phase helps identify ideal profiles for different bean origins.

Understanding the progression of these phases is critical for producing coffee that highlights its origin characteristics while meeting desired flavor expectations.
