#### **Introduction to Roast Degree Classifications**

Roast degree classifications describe the extent to which coffee beans are roasted. These classifications range from light to dark and significantly impact the sensory profile, including aroma, flavor, acidity, body, and bitterness. Each level caters to specific preferences and emphasizes different qualities of the coffee bean.

#### **1. Light Roast**

- **Overview**: Light roasts are the least processed, emphasizing the bean's intrinsic flavors and characteristics.
- **Characteristics**:
  - High acidity, floral, fruity, and delicate notes.
  - Minimal caramelization, leading to lighter sweetness and a clean flavor profile.
  - Bean color is light brown, with no visible oil on the surface.
- **Flavor Profile**:
  - Preserves the origin flavors, highlighting the terroir of the coffee.
  - Often associated with citrus, berry, and floral notes.
- **Popular Styles**:
  - **Cinnamon Roast**: Very early drop during first crack, retaining grassy and nutty flavors.
  - **City Roast**: Ends toward the end of first crack, emphasizing acidity and fruitiness.
- **Use Case**: Preferred by specialty roasters aiming to highlight complex flavors and origin-specific attributes.

#### **2. Medium Roast**

- **Overview**: Medium roasts achieve a balance between origin characteristics and roast development flavors.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Moderate acidity with a balance of sweetness and body.
  - The bean color deepens to medium brown, with slight caramelization.
  - No visible oil on the bean surface.
- **Flavor Profile**:
  - Increased caramel, nutty, and mild chocolate flavors.
  - Reduced acidity compared to light roasts but retains a clean profile.
- **Popular Styles**:
  - **Full City Roast**: Dropped just before the second crack, offering ripe fruit notes and medium body.
  - A versatile roast appealing to a broad audience for its balanced taste.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for emphasizing both origin and roast flavors, offering an approachable taste profile for most drinkers.

#### **3. Dark Roast**

- **Overview**: Dark roasts prioritize the flavors imparted by roasting rather than the bean's intrinsic characteristics.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Low acidity with dominant bitter, smoky, and pungent flavors.
  - The bean color ranges from dark brown to black, with noticeable oil on the surface.
  - Carbonization becomes evident in extreme cases.
- **Flavor Profile**:
  - Heavy body with flavors of char, toast, caramel, and dark chocolate.
  - Unique origin characteristics are largely masked by roast flavors.
- **Popular Styles**:
  - **Viennese Roast**: Dropped at the early second crack, featuring bittersweet and syrupy body.
  - **French Roast**: Characterized by pungent, burnt, and smoky flavors.
  - **Italian Roast**: Extremely dark and oily with a predominantly carbonized profile.
- **Use Case**: Popular among those who prefer strong, bold flavors and traditional espresso profiles.

#### **Comparative Table of Roast Degrees**

| **Roast Degree** | **Color**    | **Acidity** | **Sweetness** | **Body** | **Flavor Notes**               | **Surface Oil** |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Light Roast      | Light brown  | High        | Low           | Light    | Fruity, floral, citrus         | None            |
| Medium Roast     | Medium brown | Moderate    | Balanced      | Medium   | Caramel, nutty, mild chocolate | None            |

#### **Sensory and Practical Considerations**

1. **Flavor Development**: Lighter roasts preserve unique origin flavors, while darker roasts focus on roast-induced characteristics.
2. **Aroma**: Lighter roasts offer bright and floral aromas, while darker roasts present smoky and pungent notes.
3. **Body**: Body increases with roast progression, peaking at medium-dark roasts, and then declines with extremely dark roasting.
4. **Acidity**: Acidity decreases as roast degree increases, with light roasts retaining the highest levels.
5. **Oil and Storage**: Dark roasts are more prone to staling due to exposed oils, requiring airtight storage.

### Conclusion

Understanding roast degree classifications allows roasters and consumers to tailor their coffee experience. Light roasts highlight bean origins, medium roasts provide balanced flavors, and dark roasts emphasize bold and roasted characteristics. The choice of roast degree directly influences the sensory appeal and overall enjoyment of coffee.
