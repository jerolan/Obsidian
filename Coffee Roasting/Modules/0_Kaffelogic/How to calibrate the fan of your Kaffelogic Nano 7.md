### Why Fan Calibration Matters

- **Airflow Impact**: Inconsistent airflow can lead to issues like scorching or uneven roasting.
- **Transition to New Components**: Switching from an old chaff collector to a newer glass chaff collector may require recalibration.
- **Environmental Factors**: Altitude and room conditions can also influence airflow and calibration needs.

### Preparing for Calibration

1. **Firmware Update**  
    Ensure your roaster runs the latest firmware:
    
    - For USB-connected devices, update through Kaffelogic Studio.
    - For older models, use the USB stick to load the latest firmware onto the roaster.
2. **Check Equipment**
    
    - Use 120 grams of average green coffee beans (avoid extreme varieties like Monsoon Malabar or very small beans).

### Fan Calibration Process

#### Step 1: Enter Calibration Mode

1. Hold the **plus (+)** and **minus (-)** buttons while switching on the roaster.
2. Access the calibration menu.

#### Step 2: Adjust the Fan

1. Navigate to the "Fan at 40,700 RPM" option using the **menu button**.
2. Adjust the fan speed by pressing the **plus (+)** button six times.
3. Save the setting by pressing the **middle button** twice.

#### Step 3: Test Calibration

1. Load 120 grams of green coffee beans.
2. Select the "K Logic Classic" profile.
3. Observe bean circulation through the glass chaff collector:
    - Beans in the center should move gently and evenly.

### Advanced Calibration (Optional)

If basic calibration doesn’t resolve issues:

1. Use the "Fan at 14,700 RPM" option for fine-tuning.
2. Adjust fan speed using the **plus (+)** and **minus (-)** buttons until beans circulate evenly.
3. Save the new setting and test again.

### Key Considerations

- **Component Compatibility**: Ensure the collector matches your machine’s airflow needs.
- **Environmental Adjustments**: Calibrate as needed for altitude or room conditions.
- **Documentation**: Record the original and new settings for reference.

### Conclusion

Fan calibration is a straightforward but critical process to ensure the Kaffelogic Nano 7 delivers consistent and high-quality roasts. Regularly updating the firmware and monitoring airflow will keep your machine performing at its best.

Happy roasting!
